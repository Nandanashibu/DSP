Aim:
Verify following properties of DFT using Matlab/Scilab. 1.Linearity Property
2. Parsevals Theorem 3.Convolution Property 4.Multiplication Property
Theory:
1. Linearity Property
The linearity property of the DFT states that if you have two sequences x1[n] and x2[n], and their corresponding DFTs are X1[k] and X2[k], then for any scalar a and b:
DFT{a⋅x1[n]+b⋅x2[n]} = a⋅DFT{x1[n]}+b⋅DFT{x2[n]}
2. Parseval's Theorem
Parseval's theorem states that the total energy of a signal in the time domain is equal to the total energy in the frequency domain. For a sequence x[n] and its DFT X[k]:
Σ𝑵−𝟏]𝒙[𝒏]𝟐=𝟏 Σ𝑵−𝟏 𝑿[𝒌]
3. Convolution Property
𝒏=𝟎
𝑵 𝒏=𝟎
The convolution property of the DFT states that the circular convolution of two sequences in the time domain is equivalent to the element-wise multiplication of their DFTs in the frequency domain:
DFT{x1[n]⊛x2[n]}=DFT{x1[n]}⋅DFT{x2[n]}
4. Multiplication Property
The multiplication property of DFT states that pointwise multiplication in the time domain corresponds to circular convolution in the frequency domain:
DFT{x1[n]⋅x2[n]} = 𝟏DFT{x1[n]}⊛DFT{x2[n]}
