Aim: Write a MATLAB program to implement the following FIR filters using Hanning,
Hamming, Rectangular and Triangular windows.
a) Low Pass Filter
b) High Pass Filter
c) Band Pass Filter
d) Band Stop Filter

Theory
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters are a type of digital filter characterized by a finite
duration of the impulse response. The window method is a common technique used to design
FIR filters. This method involves multiplying an ideal (infinite) impulse response by a window
function to create a realizable FIR filter. The FIR filter coefficients h[n] are obtained by
multiplying the ideal impulse response by the chosen window function. The frequency response
of the FIR filter can be analyzed using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The window
function influences the main lobe width and side lobe levels in the frequency response. A
narrower main lobe provides better frequency resolution, while lower side lobes reduce spectral
leakage.
