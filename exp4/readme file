Aim:

To find circular convolution
a. Using FFT and IFFT.
b. Using Concentric Circle Method.
c. Using Matrix Method.

Theory:

Circular convolution is a mathematical operation that is like linear convolution
but is performed in a periodic or circular manner. This is particularly useful in discrete-time signal processing where signals are often represented as periodic sequences.
Mathematical Definition:
Given two periodic sequences x[n] and h[n], their circular convolution is defined as:
y[n] = (x[n] ⊛ h[n]) = Σ_{k=0} ^{N-1} x[k]h[(n-k) mod N] Applications:
 Discrete-Time Filtering: Circular convolution is used for filtering discrete-time signals.
 Digital Signal Processing: It's a fundamental operation in many digital signal processing algorithms.
 Cyclic Convolution: In certain applications, such as cyclic prefix OFDM, circular convolution is used to simplify the implementation of linear convolution.
